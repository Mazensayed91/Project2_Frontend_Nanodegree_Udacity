# Landing Project

### The project is to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

### In this project I used:
	- ES6
	- HTML5
	- CSS3

The project logic is in app.js, to run the project:

	- Clone the repo.
	- open index.html
